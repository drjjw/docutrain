To screen for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with diabetes, the following guidelines should be followed:

**Screening Recommendations**
*   Individuals with diabetes and no history of kidney disease should be screened at least annually using both blood and urine tests [2, 13].
*   For individuals with **type 1 diabetes**, screening should begin 5 years after onset or, if onset is at an earlier age, after puberty [2, 13].
*   For individuals with **type 2 diabetes**, screening should begin at diagnosis and annually thereafter [2, 13].

**Screening Tests**
*   **Blood tests** involve measuring serum creatinine to calculate the **estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)** [1, 13].
*   **Urine tests** involve measuring random **urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR)** [1, 13]. The random urine ACR is the test of choice for measuring albuminuria as it corrects for urinary concentration and correlates well with 24-hour urine collection results [6].

**Diagnosis of CKD and Diabetic Nephropathy**
*   CKD is considered present if there is a persistently elevated albuminuria of 2.0 mg/mmol on two urine samples over at least 3 months, and/or a persistent decrease in eGFR of <60 mL/min per 1.73 m² over the same period, or both [2].
*   For individuals with diabetes, the ACR threshold for diagnosing A2 albuminuria is 2.0 mg/mmol [13, 7].
*   Diabetic nephropathy is diagnosed if at least two out of three abnormal ACRs (≥2.0 mg/mmol) are found over at least 3 months [6].
*   If urine ACR is positive but <20 mg/mmol, repeat for 2 of 3 positive over at least 3 months [2].
*   If urine ACR is ≥20 mg/mmol, diabetic nephropathy can be diagnosed [2].

**Important Considerations**
*   Screening for CKD should be delayed if transient conditions such as recent major exercise, urinary tract infection, severe febrile illness, decompensated heart failure, menstruation, or acute severe elevations in blood glucose or blood pressure are present, as these can temporarily raise ACR and reduce eGFR [7, 2].

The Chronic Kidney Disease in Diabetes: A Clinical Practice Guideline recommends several medications to slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular risk.

**Recommended Medications:**

*   **Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors (RAASi)**:
    *   Adults with diabetes and CKD, with either hypertension or albuminuria, should be recommended a RAASi (an **ACE inhibitor** or **ARB**) to delay CKD progression [1].
    *   RAASi therapy should be the foundational cardiorenal protective therapy, titrated to the maximum label or maximally tolerated dose [2].
    *   Currently available ACE inhibitors in Canada and their maximum recommended daily doses include Benazepril (40 mg), Captopril (150 mg), Cilazapril (10 mg), Enalapril (40 mg), Fosinopril (40 mg), Lisinopril (40 mg), Perindopril (8 mg), Quinapril (80 mg), Ramipril (10 mg), and Trandolapril (4 mg) [3].
    *   Currently available ARBs in Canada and their maximum recommended daily doses include Azilsartan (80 mg), Candesartan (32 mg), Eprosartan (800 mg), Irbesartan (300 mg), Losartan (100 mg), Olmesartan (40 mg), Telmisartan (80 mg), and Valsartan (320 mg) [3].
    *   Dual therapy with an ACEi and an ARB is not recommended due to increased risk of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury without additional cardiovascular or renal benefit [4].

*   **Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors (SGLT2i)**:
    *   Recommended for adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD with an eGFR between 20 and 45 mL/min per 1.73 m² (regardless of uACR), or an eGFR between 45 and 90 mL/min per 1.73 m² with uACR >20 mg/mmol, on maximally tolerated or prescribed doses of RAASis [5].
    *   This recommendation is to delay CKD progression, progression to dialysis, and reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular events [5].
    *   SGLT2i may have a minimal glucose-lowering effect at lower eGFR (<60 mL/min per 1.73 m²) but their cardiorenal benefits persist [6].
    *   Three SGLT2 inhibitors available in Canada are canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin [7].

*   **Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP1-RA)**:
    *   Recommended for adults with type 2 diabetic nephropathy defined by eGFR between 25 and 50 mL/min per 1.73 m² (with uACR between 10 and 500 mg/mmol), or if eGFR is >50 mL/min per 1.73 m² (with uACR between 30 and 500 mg/mmol), on maximally tolerated or prescribed doses of RAASi [8].
    *   The purpose is to reduce proteinuria and the risk of worsening kidney function [8]. Subcutaneous semaglutide has proven kidney benefit [8].
    *   For glycemic management in persistent diabetic nephropathy, GLP1-RA is suggested over SGLT2i and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRA) [9].

*   **Nonsteroidal Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists (nsMRA)**:
    *   Recommended for adults with type 2 diabetic nephropathy defined by eGFR between 25 and 90 mL/min per 1.73 m² (with uACR between 3 and 30 mg/mmol, with or without diabetic retinopathy, for those with eGFR between 25 and 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²), or if eGFR is >25 mL/min per 1.73 m² (with uACR between 30 and 500 mg/mmol), on maximally tolerated or prescribed doses of RAASi, with a serum potassium ≤4.8 mmol/L [10].
    *   This is recommended with potassium monitoring to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes [10]. Finerenone has proven efficacy [10].
    *   Caution should be exercised due to the risk of hyperkalemia with nsMRA [11].

**Sequencing of Therapies**:
*   Cardiorenal protective therapy should initially begin with an ACEi or ARB, titrated to the maximum label or tolerated dose [2].
*   After RAASi, the choice of additional kidney protective medications should be based on individual values, preferences, blood pressure, blood glucose, potassium levels, eGFR, Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) projected risk, weight management, and contraindications or adverse effects [2].
*   Combining drug therapies has demonstrated benefit [12].

✅ AI Response (1555 chars):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The recommended approach to managing hypertension in diabetic patients focuses on specific blood pressure targets and the use of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System inhibitors (RAASi) [1, 2].

**Blood Pressure Targets**
*   Individuals with diabetes should aim for a target **systolic BP of <130 mmHg** and a **diastolic BP of <80 mmHg** [1, 2]. These targets are consistent with the BP treatment thresholds [1, 2].

**Pharmacologic Management**
*   **RAASi Recommendation**: Adults with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who have either hypertension or albuminuria should be recommended a RAASi (an ACE inhibitor [ACEi] or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker [ARB]) [3].
    *   This is recommended to delay the progression of CKD [3].
    *   RAASi can reduce the risk of developing CKD in diabetes independently of their effect on blood pressure [4].
    *   Both ACEi and ARB slow the progression of kidney disease and are cardioprotective in people with diabetes [4].
*   **Dosage**: RAASi should be prescribed at maximally tolerated or maximally recommended doses [5, 6].
*   **Dual Therapy**: Adding both an ACEi and an ARB together is not recommended, as there is no additional cardiovascular or renal benefit over monotherapy with either class, and it increases the risk of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury [7].
*   **Monitoring**: Potassium levels should be checked between 1 and 2 weeks after initiation or titration of RAASi [8].
