# Fair Use Clarification - No Percentage Thresholds

## Important Legal Clarification

**There is NO established percentage threshold for fair use in U.S. copyright law.**

### Common Misconception
Many people believe that copying less than a certain percentage (e.g., 10%, 30%) automatically qualifies as fair use. **This is incorrect.**

### Actual Fair Use Determination

Fair use is determined by evaluating **four factors** on a case-by-case basis:

1. **Purpose and Character of the Use**
   - Transformative vs. commercial
   - Educational vs. commercial
   - Commentary, criticism, parody

2. **Nature of the Copyrighted Work**
   - Factual works (more amenable to fair use)
   - Creative works (stronger protection)
   - Published vs. unpublished

3. **Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used**
   - **Key point:** Even small amounts can be infringing if they capture the "heart" of the work
   - Example: 300 words from a 30,000-word memoir was NOT fair use because it contained the most significant part
   - Quality matters more than quantity

4. **Effect on the Market**
   - Does the use substitute for the original?
   - Does it harm potential market value?
   - Does it serve a different purpose?

### Educational Guidelines (Not Legally Binding)

Some educational institutions suggest guidelines like:
- Copying up to 10% of a work
- Copying up to 1,000 words
- Copying one chapter

**These are NOT legally binding** and do not guarantee fair use protection. They are general recommendations for educational use.

### Our Analysis

Instead of relying on percentages, our fair use argument is based on:

1. **Transformative Use:** 94-96% original synthesis, not verbatim copying
2. **Factual Work:** Clinical guidelines contain factual medical information
3. **Non-Substitutive:** Does not replace the need for original guidelines
4. **Educational Purpose:** Enhances accessibility for healthcare professionals
5. **Minimal Amount:** Only uses what's necessary to answer specific questions

### Conclusion

We should **NOT** claim that our use is "well below fair use thresholds (<30%)" because:
- ❌ There are no established percentage thresholds
- ❌ Even small amounts can be infringing if they capture the "heart"
- ✅ Our argument should focus on the four factors, not percentages

**Correct approach:** Emphasize transformative use, factual nature of work, non-substitutive purpose, and educational value - not percentage thresholds.
