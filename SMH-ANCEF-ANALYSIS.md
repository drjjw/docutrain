## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Chunks analyzed** | 5 |
| **Average response-based verbatim ratio** | **4.82%** |
| **Average chunk-based verbatim ratio** | 2.16% |
| **Original synthesis** | **95.2%** |
| **Status** | ✅ **STRONGLY TRANSFORMATIVE** |

## Key Findings

### 1. Higher Verbatim Ratio for Specific Dosing Information
- **Chunk 162:** 14.18% verbatim (highest)
- This chunk contains the exact dosing information requested
- **Why higher?** Dosing information is highly specific and factual - cannot be paraphrased without losing precision
- Examples: "1g in ONE exchange/day" - this exact phrasing is necessary for medical accuracy

### 2. Transformative Organization
- **Source format:** Bullet points and prose scattered across multiple pages
- **AI format:** Organized table with clear structure
- **Value added:**
  - Condensed information from multiple chunks into single table
  - Added clear headers and structure
  - Made dosing information easier to understand and reference

### 3. Multi-Source Synthesis
- AI response synthesizes information from:
  - Chunk 161 (general peritonitis management)
  - Chunk 162 (specific Cefazolin dosing)
  - Multiple page references (156, 157, 166, 167)
- Creates coherent answer that doesn't exist verbatim in any single chunk

### 4. Still Strongly Transformative
- **Overall average:** 4.82% verbatim
- **95.2% original synthesis**
- Even the highest individual chunk (14.18%) is well within transformative use
- The verbatim portions are necessary factual data (dosing amounts) that cannot be paraphrased

## Comparison to Diabetes Canada Analysis

| Document | Average Verbatim Ratio | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| **Diabetes Canada (dc)** | 1.9-4.9% | General clinical guidance |
| **SMH Manual (smh)** | 4.82% | Specific dosing information |

**Observation:** SMH analysis shows slightly higher verbatim ratio, which is expected because:
- Dosing information is more specific and factual
- Medical dosing cannot be paraphrased without losing precision
- Still strongly transformative (95.2% original synthesis)

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates **strong transformative use**:

1. ✅ **95.2% original synthesis** - strongly transformative
2. ✅ **Organizational transformation** - converts prose/bullets into structured table
3. ✅ **Multi-source synthesis** - combines information from multiple chunks
4. ✅ **Educational value added** - makes dosing information more accessible
5. ✅ **Verbatim portions justified** - necessary factual data (dosing amounts) that cannot be paraphrased

The higher verbatim ratio in Chunk 162 (14.18%) is expected and acceptable because:
- It contains specific dosing information that must be precise
- Medical dosing cannot be paraphrased without risking accuracy
- The overall response is still 95.2% original synthesis
- The organization and structure add significant value

**Fair Use Analysis:** This use qualifies as fair use based on:
- **Transformative purpose:** Reorganizes and structures information
- **Factual work:** Clinical dosing guidelines
- **Minimal amount:** Only uses necessary dosing information
- **Non-substitutive:** Doesn't replace need for original manual
