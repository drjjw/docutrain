# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: Vanilla JavaScript Chat Components

**These files are deprecated and no longer used.**

## Status

This directory contains the **old vanilla JavaScript implementation** of the chat interface. All functionality has been migrated to the React/TypeScript version.

## Migration Complete

- ✅ All chat functionality has been migrated to React (`app-src/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`)
- ✅ All UI components have been migrated to React (`app-src/src/components/Chat/`)
- ✅ All hooks and utilities have been migrated (`app-src/src/hooks/`, `app-src/src/utils/`)

## Current Active Version

**Use the React app instead:**
- Location: `app-src/` directory
- Route: `/app/chat`
- Entry Point: `app-src/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`

## Why Keep These Files?

These files are kept for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding legacy behavior
- Debugging if needed

**DO NOT:**
- Make changes to these files
- Use these files for new features
- Reference these files for current implementation

## If You Need Something

If you're looking for current chat functionality:
1. Check `app-src/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx` for the main chat page
2. Check `app-src/src/components/Chat/` for chat components
3. Check `app-src/src/hooks/` for React hooks

**Last Updated**: Migration completed - React version is now the active implementation
